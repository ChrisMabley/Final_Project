            <p>Populated mainly by smaller freshwater fish, but also used as bredding grounds for migratory salt water fish</p>
            <h6>Ponds</h6>
            <p>Populated with varieties of smaller freshwater fish, depending on the region. Being a smaller body of water limites the potential for bio-diversity</p>
            <h6>Lakes</h6>
            <p>Home to the much larger species of freshwater fish. They also have much more diverse populations due to their much larger size.</p>
            <h6>Ocean</h6>
            <p>Convering 70% of the planet and stretching to many miles deep, the variety of species far outweighs any other body of water. </p>
